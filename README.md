# Odin RPS

A simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors written in JS. This project was created as part of the Odin Project.

## How to play

Press the button corresponding to your move and the results of that round will be displayed below. Since the JS script was the focus of this project, there is no fancy styling, as this is demonstrated in other projects. The score of each round is accumulated and the winner of the game is the first to get to 5 points!
